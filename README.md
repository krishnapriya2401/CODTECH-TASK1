**Overview**:
I developed a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and persist tasks using local storage. It ensures that tasks remain saved even after refreshing the page.

**Objectives**
*Create a functional and intuitive task management interface.
*Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
*Use local storage to persist data between sessions.
**What I Learned**
Structuring and styling a webpage with HTML and CSS.
Managing state and user interactions using JavaScript.
Using local storage for data persistence.
This project strengthened my skills in frontend development and taught me how to create interactive applications.
